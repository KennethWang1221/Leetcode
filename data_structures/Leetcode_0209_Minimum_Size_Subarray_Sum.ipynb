    "# Why Backtracking is Not Suitable for LeetCode 209\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Exploring All Possible Subarrays is Inefficient**\n",
    "\n",
    "Backtracking explores every possible subarray to find the one whose sum is greater than or equal to the target. For an array of size `n`, this leads to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **O(n²) subarrays** (since each subarray is defined by a start and end point).\n",
    "- Recalculating the sum for each subarray increases the time complexity, making backtracking inefficient with a potential **O(2ⁿ)** time complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Redundancy in Recalculating Sums**\n",
    "\n",
    "Backtracking does not leverage the **contiguous nature** of subarrays. Every new subarray requires recalculating the sum from scratch, leading to redundant work. Efficient algorithms avoid this by maintaining a running sum across iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Sliding Window is More Optimal**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **sliding window** technique is a more efficient approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It dynamically adjusts the size of the subarray while maintaining a running sum.\n",
    "- The time complexity is **O(n)**, which is optimal for this problem compared to the exponential time complexity of backtracking.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Backtracking is Overkill for Simple Conditions**\n",
    "\n",
    "Backtracking is usually used for more complex problems involving decision trees or constraint satisfaction. In this problem, the only condition is whether the sum of the subarray is greater than or equal to the target, which can be efficiently solved with simpler algorithms like sliding window.\n",
    "\n",
    "------\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Backtracking is **inefficient** for LeetCode 209 because it leads to unnecessary recalculations and explores all possible subarrays. The **sliding window** technique is optimal, providing an **O(n)** solution by dynamically adjusting the subarray size and maintaining a running sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "------\n",
    "\n",
    "# When to Use Backtracking\n",
    "\n",
    "Backtracking is a recursive algorithmic technique best suited for problems that require exploring multiple possible solutions and pruning paths that violate constraints early. It is optimal in scenarios where brute-force search would be inefficient due to the large solution space but constraints can be used to eliminate invalid paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Problem Types for Backtracking\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Combinatorial Problems**\n",
    "\n",

    "- LeetCode 78: Subsets\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Backtracking is a natural fit for problems where values must be assigned to variables while satisfying constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **N-Queens Problem**: Placing queens on a chessboard.\n",
    "- **Sudoku Solver**: Filling a Sudoku board based on rules.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 3. **Decision Problems**\n",
    "\n",
    "Backtracking works well when you need to find **a valid solution** (or all solutions) that meet specific conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pathfinding in Mazes**: Finding all paths from start to end.\n",

    "\n",
    "- LeetCode 79: Word Search\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Optimization Problems**\n",
    "\n",
    "In cases where you need to optimize (maximize or minimize) certain parameters, backtracking can be effective if no better deterministic approach exists:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Knapsack Problem**: Finding the best subset of items.\n",
    "- **Partition Problems**: Dividing a set into subsets based on conditions.\n",

    "\n",
    "------\n",
    "\n",
    "## When is Backtracking Optimal?\n",
    "\n",
    "- The problem is **naturally recursive** and can be broken into subproblems.\n",
    "- **Brute-force search** is infeasible, but **pruning invalid solutions** early can significantly reduce the search space.\n",
    "- The problem is **NP-complete** or involves exploring combinatorial possibilities with **no faster deterministic solution**.\n",
    "- You need to **find all valid solutions** or solutions that meet certain constraints recursively.\n",
    "\n",
    "------\n",
    "\n",
    "## Classic Backtracking Problems\n",
