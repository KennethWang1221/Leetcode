    "# Understanding Heaps and heapq in Python\n",
    " \n",
    "A heap is a special tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. In a min-heap, the key at a parent node is less than or equal to the keys of its children, making it easy to access the smallest element.\n",
    " \n",
    "## Using heapq.heapify()\n",
    " \n",
    "The `heapq.heapify()` function is used to convert a regular list into a heap. This is necessary because Python’s heapq functions, such as `heappop` and `heappush`, require a heap-ordered list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Attempting to use heappop on a non-heap list\n",
    " \n",
    "```python\n",
    "import heapq\n",
    " \n",
    "stones = [2, 7, 4, 1, 8, 1]\n",
    "heapq.heappop(stones)  # ❌ ERROR: This is NOT a valid heap!\n",
    "```\n",
    " \n",
    "**Issue:** The list `stones` is not a heap, so using `heappop` directly will result in an error.\n",
    " \n",
    "**Solution:** Use `heapq.heapify()` to transform the list into a valid heap.\n",
    " \n",
    "```python\n",
    "import heapq\n",
    " \n",
    "stones = [2, 7, 4, 1, 8, 1]\n",
    "heapq.heapify(stones)  # ✅ Converts list into a valid min-heap\n",
    "heapq.heappop(stones)  # ✅ Now works fine\n",
    "```\n",
    " \n",
    "## When heapq.heapify() is Unnecessary\n",
    " \n",
    "If you build a heap from scratch using `heappush`, starting with an empty list, the list is already a valid heap, and you don't need to call `heapq.heapify()`.\n",
    " \n",
    "### Example: Building a heap using heappush\n",
    " \n",
    "```python\n",
    "import heapq\n",

    "Why Python's heapq Implements a Min-Heap:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Simplicity and Efficiency:\n",
    "    - A min-heap ensures that the smallest element is always accessible in constant time.\n",
    "    - This property is particularly useful for algorithms like Dijkstra's shortest path or Huffman encoding, where repeatedly accessing the smallest element is essential.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Flexibility Through Less Complexity:\n",
    "    - Implementing a min-heap avoids the additional complexity that comes with managing a max-heap.\n",
    "    - Since many use cases naturally align with the min-heap behavior, heapq prioritizes this to maintain simplicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Customizability:\n",
    "    - Even though heapq only provides a min-heap, its simplicity allows developers to adapt it to function as a max-heap when needed without significant overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementing a Max-Heap Using heapq:\n",
    " - While heapq does not provide a max-heap out of the box, you can simulate a max-heap using one of the following methods:"
