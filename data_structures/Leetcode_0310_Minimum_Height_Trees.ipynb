    "The Minimum Height Trees problem is a graph theory problem that asks us to find the minimum height trees in an undirected graph. In other words, we need to find the nodes in the graph that, if removed, would result in a new graph with the smallest maximum distance from any remaining node to the nearest leaf node.\n",
