    "# When to Use Backtracking\n",
    "\n",
    "Backtracking is a recursive algorithmic technique best suited for problems that require exploring multiple possible solutions and pruning paths that violate constraints early. It is optimal in scenarios where brute-force search would be inefficient due to the large solution space but constraints can be used to eliminate invalid paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Problem Types for Backtracking\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Combinatorial Problems**\n",
    "\n",
    "Backtracking excels in problems where all possible combinations, permutations, or subsets need to be explored:\n",

    "- **Subset Problems**: Finding all subsets of a set.\n",
    "- **Combination Problems**: Finding combinations that meet certain criteria.\n",
    "- **Permutation Problems**: Generating all possible permutations.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- LeetCode 39: Combination Sum\n",

    "### 6. **Sequence Generation with Constraints**\n",

    "## When is Backtracking Optimal?\n",
    "\n",
    "- The problem is **naturally recursive** and can be broken into subproblems.\n",
    "- **Brute-force search** is infeasible, but **pruning invalid solutions** early can significantly reduce the search space.\n",

    "# Backtracking vs. DFS: A Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Purpose**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Backtracking**: Primarily used to **solve constraint-based problems** by exploring multiple paths and pruning those that are invalid. It is focused on **finding solutions** rather than just exploring all possibilities.\n",
    "- **DFS**: Used for **graph traversal**, systematically visiting all nodes and edges in a graph. DFS explores **all nodes or paths** regardless of constraints, unless an early stopping condition is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Traversal Approach**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Backtracking**: Involves **exploring a path** deeply, but if an invalid or suboptimal solution is encountered, the algorithm **prunes** that path and backtracks to try another path.\n",
    "- **DFS**: Involves **traversing all possible nodes or paths** deeply in the graph until there are no more paths to explore from the current node, but it doesn't prune paths unless explicitly told to.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Use of Pruning**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Backtracking**: Actively uses **pruning** to skip unnecessary or invalid paths based on the constraints of the problem. This makes it more efficient than a pure brute-force search.\n",
    "- **DFS**: Does not typically prune paths unless there are conditions to stop the traversal early (like finding a specific target). It usually explores **all possible paths** from the starting node.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Problem Types**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Backtracking**: Best suited for problems where multiple **solutions** need to be explored under specific constraints (e.g., N-Queens, Sudoku, combination and permutation problems).\n",
    "- **DFS**: Commonly used for **graph-related problems** such as finding connected components, detecting cycles, or pathfinding.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Complexity**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Backtracking**: Often has a time complexity of **O(2ⁿ)** or worse depending on the number of possibilities, but **pruning** helps reduce unnecessary exploration, making it more efficient in some cases.\n",
    "- **DFS**: Has a time complexity of **O(V + E)**, where `V` is the number of vertices and `E` is the number of edges, because it explores the entire graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Examples**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Backtracking\n",
    "\n",
    "  :\n",
    "\n",
    "  - N-Queens problem (pruning invalid queen placements).\n",
    "  - Sudoku Solver (pruning invalid number choices).\n",
    "\n",
    "- DFS\n",
    "\n",
    "  :\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Finding all connected components in a graph.\n",
    "  - Pathfinding between two nodes in a graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "------\n",
    "\n",
    "# Summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Backtracking** is a more **solution-oriented** approach that uses **pruning** to avoid unnecessary exploration of paths that won’t lead to valid solutions. It is commonly used in problems that involve **constraints**.\n",
    "- **DFS** is a **graph traversal algorithm** that explores all nodes and paths systematically, often used for **traversing and searching** in graph-based problems. While both methods explore deeply, DFS is less concerned with constraints and pruning than backtracking.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both techniques can be considered brute-force, but backtracking is more efficient when constraints allow paths to be pruned early, while DFS exhaustively explores the entire graph or solution space."
